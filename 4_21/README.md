#Gay Twitter Analysis

This is a project I am conducting to analyze how Queer Twitter users explore gender freedom. This code will be used for analysis within our paper, tying together NLP, Sociolinguistics, and Data Analysis to look at trends and verbiage in the ways people express themselves.

There will be a strong emphasis on trans and non-binary people within this research.
