# TwitterQTAnalysis

This repository is a Computational Linguistics project exploring how Twitter users use language and neologisms to express gender freedom. The code for this project will support a research paper exploring these themes. I use regex, Pandas, Matplotlib within this project to reach conclusions and display visualizations. As I continue to work on this, I also hope to include exploration of n-grams within the tweets and possible machine learning to gauge user sentiment.
